# Story behind this patch

- During WorldJam performances performers need to change servers multiple times. Using the currently available method this is not convenient.
- Sound engineers and other organisers need to move around a lot too.
- Most of these transitions are pre-defined and lists can be generated to provide a convenient path through the process.
